Challonge Scheduler
===================

Written by [@dustinsoftware](http://twitter.com/dustinsoftware).

This app will automatically schedule open matches in your Challonge tournament bracket and assign them to the next open station.  The priority is determined by waiting time: the person that has waited the longest will be placed on the next available station.

### Requirements: 
Windows XP, .NET 4.0, and a half-decent Internet connection

### What does that circle mean?
The circle in the upper right indicates the update status:
* Green - Up to date
* Yellow - Updating
* Red - Error updating

Click on the circle to change the app into a movable window.

### To use this for your tournament:

Modify the values in Challonge.exe.config to reflect your tournament bracket (e.g. number of stations, your API key, and tournament ID.

### It doesn't work!
You're probably doing it wrong.  Make sure your tournament ID and API key are correct.  If you're still running into issues, check out the log and send an email to ceo@dustinsoftware.com.
